The definition of mass shooting used for the Stanford database is 3 or more 
shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities), not including the shooter. 
Identifiably gang, drug or organized 
crime related shootings are not included in the database.

The key difference between the Stanford MSA and other similar projects is 
the scope of definition and the focus on mass shooting incidents versus mass murder. 
Instead of limiting our data collection to incidents in which 4 or more fatalities occurred 
(the FBI definition for Mass Murder), we instead collect incidents of 3 or more 
shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities). All mass shooting definitions are arbitrary 
in that there is no natural way to quantify such an event. 
In setting up our threshold we wanted to focus on the shootings over the outcomes.
